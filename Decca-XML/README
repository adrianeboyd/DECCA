In working with a range of dependency corpora which make different
assumptions about dependency structures, we found that we needed a
format that allowed the possibility for a word to have more than one
head or possibly no head at all. The Malt-XML format provided a useful
and simple XML format for dependency treebanks, so we modified and
extended the Malt-XML schema to add the features we needed.

The main differences between Malt-XML and Decca-XML:

* <head> has been renamed to <header>

* the head and deprel attributes of a <word> have been moved to an

element <head id="" deprel=""/> within each word

* the additional token types <subword> and <abstract> have been
added

* all sentence and token elements contain an optional externid
attribute that can be used to refer back to an ID in the original
corpus

We provide the Decca-XML schema and scripts to convert Malt-XML and
the CoNLL-X shared task format to Decca-XML.
